## Self Driving Car

Goal is to build an autonomous car capable of making decision itself. Decision logic will be based on sensor data and vision data. We will be using Arduino for differential drive and a Raspberry pi device for autonomy of vision processing.
**This project is under processing and is supposed to be done by our team at acmElectronics.**

### To DO
[x] Arduino Differential Drive
[ ] Traffic signal based on Arduino
[ ] Raspberry Pi interfcing of Arduino

**More details will be updated soon..**
